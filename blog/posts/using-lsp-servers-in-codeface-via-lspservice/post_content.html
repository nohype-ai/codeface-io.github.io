<p>
LSPService is a free open source webservice that can provide <a href="../../../index.html">Codeface</a> finer granularity and information about actual architecture:
</p>

<p>
For example, it allows <a href="../../../index.html">Codeface</a> to show the symbols (like classes and functions) and dependencies in your code base.
</p>

<h2>Download and Run</h2>

<p>
Simply download LSPService and run it locally on your machine. <a href="../../../index.html">Codeface</a> will automatically detect LSPService and talk to it.

<p>
On you first attempt to launch LSPService, you'll probably need to confirm that intention via the security settings:

<p>
LSPService will run in terminal, and as long as it's running there, the service is available. Check <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.
</p>

<h2>Add Language Support</h2>

<p>
If Xcode is installed, LSPService automatically finds <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp" target="_blank">Apple's LSP server (SourceKit-LSP)</a>, which supports Swift code. Using it with Swift code, you have to be aware of a few things:
<ul>
    <li>SourceKit-LSP supports Swift Packages but not Xcode projects.</li>
    <li>To update what SourceKit-LSP can "see", you have to <code>`swift build`</code> the package from the console before importing it into a Codeface file. This is due to a <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp#caveats">caveat</a> of SourceKit-LSP, which is still at an early stage.</li>
    <li>Sometimes, deleting the hidden ".build" folder within the package before building it helps to update everything. You can show and hide hidden files on macOS via shift + âŒ˜ + . (Shift + Command + Dot).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The same LSP server from Apple should also work for Objective-c, C++ and C (see below).
</p>

<p>
Generally, you must provide locations of <a href="https://langserver.org">LSP servers</a> for the languages you care about: LSPService creates an LSPServiceConfig.json file on launch if the file doesn't exist yet. If the file exists, LSPService loads server configurations from the file. The JSON structure is quite self-explanatory:
</p>

<pre><code>
{
    "swift" : {
        "path" : "/usr/bin/xcrun",
        "arguments" : [
            "sourcekit-lsp"
        ],
        "environment" : {
            "SOURCEKIT_LOGGING" : "0"
        }
    }
}</code>
</pre>

<p>
Just add language server entries to the file and then restart LSPService. Arguments and environment may of course remain empty.
</p>

<p>
In the future, LSPService will help more with installing and locating LSP servers for common languages. Learn more (or even contribute) <a href="https://github.com/flowtoolz/LSPService">on GitHub</a>.
