        <h2>General Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>üìï What If I Don't Want to Read an FAQ?</h3>
        <p>
        You can always write at <a href="mailto:hello@codeface.io">hello@codeface.io</a> to get personal support.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üìï What Does Codeface Do Exactly?</h3>
        <p>
        Have a look at <a href="../blog/posts/visualizing-sourcekit-lsp-in-codeface/index.html">this showcase</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üìï How Can I Try It Out Quickly?</h3>
        <p>
        Install Codeface <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/codeface/id1578175415" target="_blank">from the Mac App Store</a>. Then download and open <a href="../blog/posts/try-codeface-with-codebase-files-to-download/index.html">one of theses files</a>.

        <h2>General Trouble Shooting</h2>
        
        <h3>üìï Why Do I Not See Any Arrows?</h3>
        <p>
        To see dependency arrows and symbols, Codeface must talk to LSPService while importing a code folder. LSPService is a free open-source webservice that you can download and run on your machine. It can launch LSP servers and thereby provide Codeface detailed information about codebases of virtually all languages.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <a href="../blog/posts/using-lsp-servers-in-codeface-via-lspservice/index.html">This tutorial</a> describes how to setup and use LSPService.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üìï Why Do I Even Need LSPService? That's Cumbersome!</h3>
        <p>
        And indeed it is more cumbersome than we would have liked. Because of the App Store rules, it took a lot of work to make an app that uses LSP servers available in the App Store at all.
        </p>
        <p>
        We're already working on a way to launch LSP servers directly without requiring LSPService, but that‚Äôs non-trivial for App Store apps and will take some time to get working. Because of that, significant new features are currently all on hold.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üìï How Does LSPService Work?</h3>
        <p>
        Have a look at <a href="../blog/posts/using-lsp-servers-in-codeface-via-lspservice/index.html">this tutorial</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üìï Why Does The Code Import Take So Long?</h3>
        <p>
        When using an LSP server, importing larger codebases does indeed take long because requests to LSP servers <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/sourcekitservice-only-using-50-of-cpu/53747" target="_blank">can not generally be made in parallel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can accelerate loading a codebase visualization again by saving it to a .codebase file. Such a file stores a whole codebase, including all the data retrieved from an LSP server. Loading a codebase from file is much faster. So when you don't need to update the visualization, you can open it in Codeface without waiting for the LSP server.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Trouble Shooting For Swift Code</h2>
        
        <h3>üìï Why Can I Not Visualize My Xcode Project?</h3>
        <p>
        Codeface can import any code folder. But it can <b>not</b> open, import or otherwise know anything about Xcode projects. This is because <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp" target="_blank">Apple's LSP server</a> does not support Xcode projects but only <a href="https://www.swift.org/package-manager" target="_blank">Swift packages</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We suspect that <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp" target="_blank">Apple's LSP server</a> will never support Xcode projects but that instead the <a href="https://www.swift.org/package-manager" target="_blank">Swift Package Manager</a> might some day support app targets and thereby¬†more or less replace Xcode project files.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If your code is in an Xcode project, you can use a little "trick" to visualize it: Extract as much of it as possible into one or multiple local Swift packages. Many developers do that anyway to speed up compiles and to manifest/enforce architectural boundaries.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üìï Why Is My Swift Package Not Visualized Correctly?</h3>
        <p>
        As described in <a href="../blog/posts/using-lsp-servers-in-codeface-via-lspservice/index.html">this tutorial</a> under "Add Language Support", you have to <code>`swift build`</code> the package from the terminal before importing it into a Codebase file. This will update what <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp" target="_blank">Apple's LSP server</a> can "see" during the import.
        </p>
        <p>
        Sometimes, it's also necessary to delete the hidden ".build" folder inside the package folder before building the package. You can show and hide hidden files on macOS via shift + ‚åò + . (Shift + Command + Dot).
